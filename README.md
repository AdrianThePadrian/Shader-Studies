# IGC Midterm
 used https://cpetry.github.io/NormalMap-Online/ to generate normal maps for grass

 used https://opengameart.org/content/3-seamless-grass-textures for grass textures

 used Skybox Series Free from the asset store for cube maps and skyboxes

 For the body of the ship I used physically based rendering labelled as PBR in the shaders in which I take the metallic texture and make it as smooth as possible to reflect as much light from the skybox and other light sources
